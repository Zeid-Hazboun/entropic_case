Flexible Efficient Electrification of Industrial Heat Cases,https://ispt.eu/projects/flexible-efficient-electrification-of-industrial-heat-cases/,HP-50-02,Ongoing,"November 13, 2023","Electrification of heat-driven processes is needed for a substantial reduction of CO 2  emissions. However, the challenge is to efficiently move to full electrification while coping with the high variability of the availability and price of electricity. Additionally, there is the co-existence of natural gas boilers and grid connection limitations. This project will develop potential routes based on available technologies through two virtual public simulation cases. These simulationas will enable partners to share and promote their expertise without having to disclose confidential information.  
 In short: 
 
 This project will develop innovative process designs solving the efficient flexible electrification challenge 
 The designs are simulated through two distinct virtual cases: agro-food and chemicals, allowing for open innovation   
 The industry, technology suppliers and technology experts participate by sharing their knowledge and expertise  
 Increased efficiency in flexible electrification of heat-driven processes saves substantial amounts of energy. This contributes to a CO 2 -neutral industrial heat system  
 
 The impact of efficient and flexible electrification 
 Large-scale electrification of industry is necessary for achieving CO 2  reduction and gas dependency reduction. However, moving towards full electrification, while natural gas boilers still co-exist and grid connections are limited, is challenging. Moreover, companies struggle with the high variability and price of electricity.   
 The development of collaborative insights that can help to overcome these challenges usually requires the disclosure of confidential process information. For this reason, the Flexible Efficient Electrification of Industrial Heat Cases project develops two different simulations that will allow companies to share their insights into the specific challenges of industrial heat driven processes, without having to share company specific confidential information. This open innovation concept also allows technology suppliers to cooperate and communicate about concrete solutions for realistic and recognizable industrial processes. Through the project, the industry gets insights in potential combinations of available technologies to solve the challenges in their own heat-driven processes to achieve efficient and flexible electrification. This will stimulate a CO 2 -neutral industrial heat system.​  
 Two virtual cases 
 The aim of the project is to develop innovative process designs solving the efficient flexible electrification challenge of the agro-food and chemical industry processes. 
 Together with FME, ISPT has set up two realistic virtual cases. These cases are meant as inspirational realistic examples for all industries. They include the most relevant heat-related unit operations of an agro-food and chemical production process. By setting up these cases virtually, it is possible to share information and data on unit operations and possible smart solutions for electrification, even when these solutions are at the heart of the production process. 
 
 
 Chemistry  
 
 
 Agro-Food 
 
 
 The activities 
 Throughout this initiative the consortium will focus on: 
 
 Joint development between process industry and technology suppliers on two real public cases. This collaboration includes the development of possible process designs with new technologies for renewable energy, electrification, and energy storage. 
 Communication and dissemination through open publications and regular joint physical meetings with the consortium. The aim is to present and discuss interim results and potential solutions from external organizations or student groups. 
 
 The expected results 
 Through a series of in-depth meetings on each case, the industry (agro-food and chemicals), technology suppliers, and technology experts work together to develop innovative solutions. They will approach the cases from different angles, perspectives and conditions. The solutions incorporate technologies that are, or will soon be, available. Moreover, various challenges are considered, such as: transition to zero-emission, integration into congested grid, growing supply of renewables, local restrictions or opportunities.  
 Potential elements of these solutions include hybridisation, temporary scaling down of processes in times of shortage, energy storage to capture the surpluses, local renewable energy generation and heat pumps for efficient electrification of heat driven processes.

FUSE – FUll ScalE Industrial Heat Pump Using Natural Refrigerants,https://ispt.eu/projects/fuse/,UH-30-05,Ongoing,N/A,"Supporting the development and success of an industrial heat pump market through the develeopment of a standardized, modular, flexible compression heat pump technology. 
 Incentive 
 High temperature industrial heat pumps are an emerging technology that play a decisive role in providing a sustainable solution for industrial heat demand up to 200°C. Previous ISPT and TKI E&I projects (CATCH-IT, STEPS) have demonstrated the operation of pilot scale compression heat pumps for industrial applications, however CAPEX costs in the order of 500 €/kWth proved to be prohibitive for market introduction.  
 Market and cost reduction studies in the CRUISE project (ongoing) revealed that typical industrial capacities are 1-10 MWth and a lack of standardization for these units and the use of a flammable refrigerant were the most important cost determining factors. However, use of a non-flammable synthetic working medium (HFOs) still poses concerns about not being a long term sustainable solution. 
 The development and success of an industrial heat pump market is indeed dependent on the ability to produce a standardized, modular, flexible compression heat pump technology on a scale level of 1-10 MWth that uses a natural refrigerant and has low CAPEX. 
 Objectives 
 The specific goals to be achieved within the duration of the FUSE project are defined as follows: 
 Develop a full-scale (1-2 MW), steam producing, industrial heat pump using natural working media that uses waste heat sources in the range of 60°C-90°C and produces medium pressure steam (range of 2-5 bar) with a specific investment cost of < 200 €/kWth (excluding integration). Develop a modular compression heat pump design utilizing a limited number of standardized components that can be configured in numerous ways to cover > 70% of the industrial heat pump market. This enables series production and therewith low costs (< 200 €/kWth) and offers still flexibility with respect to operating conditions (power, temperature). Establish a Dutch manufacturer ( Heinen & Hopman ) for the standardized, modular, flexible compression heat pump. Establish heat pump performance under a variety of simulated (industrial process data) static and dynamical conditions at ECN part of TNO, and under field test conditions at the DOW Terneuzen site. 
 Activities 
 Within this project, a consortium of Dutch partners will cooperate to accelerate the uptake of industrial heat pumps using natural working media. A full scale (1-2 MWth) compression heat pump is designed, constructed and tested. Its performance will be characterized through testing on a specifically created industrial heat pump test infrastructure at ECN part of TNO that is able to simulate a variety of process conditions.  
 In addition, the unit will be field tested at DOW Terneuzen. The heat pump is designed using a modular approach utilizing a limited number of standardized components that can be configured in numerous ways to cover a large share of the industrial heat pump market. Partner Heinen & Hopman will implement the necessary measures for establishing a Dutch manufacturer for industrial, steam producing heat pumps. 
 Results 
 Successful completion of this project results in an industrial compression heat pump product for a Dutch manufacturer at scale levels of 1-10 MW that can be produced in a standardized, modular, flexible, and cost effective way and uses a natural refrigerant. This product is able to serve a large share of the industrial heat pump market. As such, this project contributes to economic growth, such as the creation of new jobs in the heat pump sector and increasing the competitiveness of  Dutch industry . Finally, the uptake of industrial heat pumps contributes to the sustainability of Dutch industry through large reductions in both CO 2  emissions and primary energy consumption.

COMTA – COMpact modular Thermo Acoustic heat pump,https://ispt.eu/projects/comta/,UH-30-04,Ongoing,"November 1, 2018","To further develop the compact electrically driven thermoacoustic heat (TA) pump technology and to prepare for technical demonstration on full scale. 
 The industry is a large consumer of energy and about two-thirds of the industry’s energy use is represented by heat. Often high-temperature heat is required, this heat is currently provided by burning natural gas. In order for the industry to meet the climate goals we will need to move to low carbon heating systems. One way to achieve this is by implementing high temperature heat pumps. These heat pumps, however, are not yet commercially available. The COMTA project proposes to start using the electrically driven thermoacoustic heat pump for industrial purposes. It can deliver heat of up to 200°C and it can cover a very wide range of temperatures with a fixed standardized design. Because this heat pump is electrically driven, it will become completely carbon free once fully renewable electricity supplies have become a reality in the future.  
 About the COMTA project 
 The overall project objective is to further develop the compact electrically driven thermoacoustic heat (TA) pump technology and to prepare for technical demonstration on full scale. This is achieved by experimental demonstration of a high COP1 over a very wide temperature interval from 100 to over 200°C using waste heat between 50-150°C under simulated and onsite test conditions (at DOW Terneuzen utility). A single full scale modular design will be realized that can serve a wide market including (petro)chemical industry, refining, paper & food industry. By its modular design steam production can be matched to the process in the range of 1 to 10 MW by installing one up to 8 units on the piston compressor. Energy is saved and a carbon free heat supply can be realized utilizing renewable electricity. 
 The project is coordinated by  ECN.TNO . Other partners are  ISPT ,  DOW ,  Bronswerk Heat Transfer  and  Howden Compressors B.V.  
 Aimed Results 
 The COMTA proposal serves as a last stop before full scale demonstration projects are initiated. The remaining R&D work serves to improve efficiency concerns optimizing membrane and heat exchangers. This is addressed by means of experimental component testing within the existing COMTA test set-up. Integration at the DOW steam utility and the onsite testing will verify the technical feasibility under operational conditions. Realization of the full scale design will be used for the verification of the techno-economic feasibility and to prepare for the full scale testing in demo projects. This development results in net primary energy saving potential of 97 PJ per year and a CO 2  emission reduction of 4.5 million tons/year within the sectors food, paper & board bulk chemical and refineries in the Netherlands. Major fuel cost savings for Dutch industry amounting to 4.8 billion Euro can be realized. In the future renewable electricity system carbon free electricity would result in even higher CO 2  emission of 9.4 million tons/year. The worldwide market value for high temperature (steam) TA heat pump equipment and installation is estimated at 227 million euro per year during 20 years. 
 Status November 2020 
 Major developments in COMTA are the utilisation of an industrial piston compressor as driver and the strongly reduced dimensions of the pressure vessel (no resonator has been applied). Both developments will reduce future investment costs of the heat pump. 
 The COMTA heat pump set-up is commissioned in March 2020 and first successful tests series have been executed including recent tests with saturated steam delivery at 168 °C. The saturated steam is pumped from source heat delivered by an oil circuit at 94 °C. The compressor ran at 1055 rpm and a dynamic pressure amplitude of almost 2.9 bars is obtained with a static pressure of 29 bars. The internal COP in the thermoacoustic core amounts to 41% of the Carnot efficiency. This number however excludes a high temperature loss in the heat exchangers and mechanical losses in the compressor. 
 Outlook 
 The thermoacoustic heat pump part originates from a previous test setup (TASTE) and this part will be optimised for the COMTA conditions (lower drive frequency). A large increase of thermal output is expected by an increase of the working pressure, optimised heat exchangers and a new regenerator suitable for the lower frequency. In this case even higher steam delivery temperatures up to 200 °C will become feasible. Measurement of the mechanical power delivery by the piston will give insight in system losses and guidance for further improvements.

R-ACES – FRamework for Actual Cooperation on Energy on Sites and Parks,https://ispt.eu/projects/r-aces/,I40-20-06,Ongoing,N/A,"R-ACES is an international project promoted by 8 partners, from 6 European countries. Each country, has a vision to support high-potential industry parks and clusters to become fully fledged ecoregions. R-ACES means a step-change in the contribution of European industry to the climate targets of the EU. The goal is to reduce emissions at the ecoregions by at least 10%.  
 After all, the industry sector represents 25% of all energy demand – and 50% of the total cooling and heating demand on the continent. Yet, only 16% comes from renewables. Concluding, that by focusing on collective measures and clustering, we can drastically increase the efficiency of industry. 
 
 
 
 Our vision 
 Therefore, the vision of R-ACES is to support high-potential industrial parks and clusters to become ecoregions. There, we aim to achieve CO 2  emissions reduction of at least 10%. For example by exchanging surplus energy and making extensive use of renewables. Finally, we can bring everything together with so-called smart energy management systems. 
 Ecoregions 
 An ecoregion is an area where energy, material and information exchanges occur between various companies and actors to reduce waste and energy/ material consumption. Each region is centered on an (eco-)industrial park or (eco-)business park. They are linked to its surroundings by a 4th/5th generation district heating/cooling network. The project condenses the knowledge and experience gathered throughout H2020 into a set of three focused tools embedded in selected support actions.  
 R-ACES Ecoregions 
 R-ACES has set-up 3 pilot cases to test the tools designed by the project in a realistic environment. We have developed these tools for industrial actors and other stakeholders.  Currently, the pilots take place in Antwerp, Nyborg and Lombardy.  
 A validation manual will be created for the adoption of additional 7 high-priority regions in Italy, Denmark, Belgium, and the Netherlands. This will add up to 10 ecoregions. We aim to reach another 80 ecoregions through dissemination activities.  
 The pilot ecoregions are located in Antwerp, Nyborg and Lombardy 
 Three practical tools 
 R-ACES develops three practical tools to support the entire process of organising an ecoregion and the collaboration inside of it. As of right now, the 3 practical tools are the structuring element of the project. The tools incorporate existing knowledge. They are created conform the needs of stakeholders. And are presented in industrial clusters to support them during the implementation of their energy collaboration. 
 Self Assessment Tool 
 The self assessment tool consists in an assessment framework that covers multiple themes. Namely, providing best practices, check lists and means to scan energy reduction potentials. 
 Energy Management Platform 
 This ICT-tool makes energy flows transparent. Moreover, it allows energy consumption & production to be allocated to specific installations, stakeholders & nodes, and identifies anomalies & opportunities. 
 Legal Decision Support Tool 
 Additionally, we have a  Legal Decision Support Tool . This is a practical and simple-to-use tool for management to decide on the required framework for energy cooperation.

FLEXSTEAM – Development of heat storage for industrial steam,https://ispt.eu/projects/steam-storing/,UH-30-02,Ongoing,"January 1, 2019","The FLEXSTEAM project aims to improve the way we can store and re-use  thermal energy by using so called ‘Phase Changing Materials’ (PCMs).  
 To achieve a fully circular economy we will have to be able to close our material but also our energy loops. Re-using, storing and upgrading energy is an essential part of creating a sustainable system. In the industry a large part of the energy usage comes in the form of heat.  
 Heat buffering is very important for the  integration of heat pumps  in existing industrial processes. By focusing on the efficiency of processes as well as replacing fossil resources with renewable ones we will be able to greatly reduce the industrial sectors’ dependence on fossil energy.   
 About the FLEXSTEAM project 
 A challenge lies in the storage of  energy when the availability of sustainable resources to run for example the heat-pumps varies. Storing energy is in fact one of the biggest challenges we face in the energy transition because of the varying availability of renewable resources. Electrical storage is very expensive whereas thermal storage can be achieved relatively cheap by using so called ‘Phase Changing Materials’ or PCM’s. Often a composition of salts or organic materials, PCM’s change from solid to liquid and in the process store latent heat. This way they can store a lot of heat in a small amount of volume.  
 Steam storing 
 The technology developed will be used for the recovery and re-use of industrial leftover (waste) heat, directly as well as indirectly through the use of heat pumps. Apart from that it will also be able to increase the implementation rates of sustainable heat sources like geothermal and solar energy to generate process heat. Both can be used more effectively and efficiently if a thermal energy storage solution is present. 
 The FLEXSTEAM project is a joint exercise by  TNO  (project coordinator), ISPT, Royal Cosun, DOW, TataSteel B.V, Blue Terra and Bronswerk.  
 Progress and Results 
 Applications for thermal storage are identified within the processes at TataSteel and at DOW. At TataSteel the thermal storage is to be integrated in a waste heat recovery application, to generate steam. The storage system creates additional energy and cost savings by covering the mismatch between waste heat supply and steam demand. A dynamic simulation of the thermal storage system was done to calculate these annual savings, and will be used as a tool for further optimizing the sizing of the storage system.  
 At DOW the thermal storage is to be connected with the on-site CHP system, to enhance the flexible operation. The technical requirements for this thermal storage system are beyond the current possibilities of the PCM concept due to the higher temperature needed in this application. The study is focused on the general techno-economic feasibility of the thermal storage, when facilitating the flex-CHP operation in the 2030 energy system, with fluctuating prices for electricity and increased CO 2  taxes. 
 The technical development in the project, addresses the characterization and selection of a suitable PCM, optimizing the thermal conductivity of the PCM, and the development of a modular solution for PCM elements that allow industrialized production on a larger scale. Adipic acid is selected as low cost thermal storage material. It shows a very stable performance during 98 cycles of repeated melting and solidification (Figure 1). 
 With its melting temperature of 150°C it can be used to store and generate steam at 3 bar. The thermal conductivity of adipic acid is enhanced by adding graphite to it. This allows to reach charging and discharging times in the range of one hour. The composite PCM is contained in sealed tubular elements. The thermal performance in terms of charge and discharge times of these elements is characterized in laboratory tests and can be adapted to the application requirements by selecting the diameter of the tubes. 
 The design of the laboratory prototype system is based on a conventional shell & tube concept, where the tubes consist of the PCM filled  elements, closely stacked together. The PCM thermal system will be thermally charged by applying steam to the outside of the tubes, heating them above the melting temperature. In discharge mode hot water is circulated along the tubes, which will transfer their heat to generate steam again.  The prototype design is finished and construction has started. 
 Outlook 
 The first tests of the system will start in Q1-2021. Initial tests will be used to characterize the thermal performance in terms of storage capacity and heat transfer rates. Various operating conditions will be applied and results will be used to validate the thermal system model of the prototype system. 
 The test results and performance chart will also be used as input for calculating the techno-economic feasibility in the considered applications at Tatasteel and DOW. When successful results are obtained the next step is to develop a pilot project for on-site testing.

SPOT: Sustainable PrOcess heaTing,https://ispt.eu/projects/spot-sustainable-process-heating/,UH-30-08,Ongoing,"January 1, 2020","The SPOT project aims to significantly reduce the use of fossil energy use for industrial heat with at least 100 PJ/year in 2030. SPOT brings together a large consortium of knowledge and technology providers, energy consultants and industrial end-users. The consortium analyses both high and low temperature heat supply and reuse technologies. 
 In short: 
 SPOT aims to reduce the use of fossil energy use for industrial heat with at least 100 PJ/year in 2030 By proving the viability of fuel cell cogeneration for steam and electricity production in industry And testing the technical feasibility of molten salt technology for heat transfer, storage and reuse in the steel and chemistry sector 
 Chain of technologies 
 Firstly, the project will determine which chain of technologies will provide industry with the most effective way of producing high temperature heat, ultimately from carbon-free fuels. Secondly, the viability of fuel cell cogeneration for steam and electricity production in industry will be proven. Thirdly, the technical feasibility of molten salt technology for heat transfer, storage and reuse in the high temperature processes in the steel and chemistry sector is being investigated. Finally, the applicability, availability and feasibility of steam compression technology into existing processes and identify innovation and development needs is assessed. 
 SPOT-project activity matrix 
 Carbon-free fuels  
 
 Berenschot-Kalavasta have provided four cases, ranging from local to international 2050 scenarios. The development of industrial sectors, the application of specific technologies and the production of renewable electricity varies strongly between the scenarios. The industrial heat demand in 2050 was found to vary between 291 PJ/year and 668 PJ/year, depending on the scenario. Scenarios for the SPOT project were put together based on renewable electricity supply by wind onshore/offshore and solar. In addition, nuclear energy was added as an additional scenario. 
 Fuel cell cogeneration 
 CBS data is used to acquire background information on a range of Combined Heat and Power (CHP) technology use in Dutch industry. A report has been made describing fuel cell technology which can be used for co-generation of electricity and steam for industrial applications. Molten Carbonate Fuel Cells (MCFC) and Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFC) are identified. With future operation of the fuel cell as electrolyser in mind, SOFC seems the preferred technology. Multiple SOFC manufactures have been contacted to ask their interest in supplying a fuel cell stack or micro-CHP system for converting to steam generation and lab testing at TNO. 
 Heat storage with molten salts 
 The experimental facility for molten salt as heat transfer and thermal storage fluid is under construction at the TNO facilities in Petten. This test-rig, combined with a hot air supply system is used to study the properties and applicability of molten salts in industrial heating processes. It is aimed to design a heat exchanger and test it for high-temperature waste heat conditions. 
 Steam compression 
 Information on the steam use and required conditions in the drying section of a paper mill were collected, and steam compression options in the drying sections are being explored. Furthermore, the pilot testing of steam compressor technologies is being prepared.

StAgglop: Reducing energy use and material loss by better control of agglomeration during spray drying,https://ispt.eu/projects/stagglop/,DR-50-15,Ongoing,"May 1, 2020","A large part of powdered formulations within the food industry is produced by spray drying. The powder properties, such as its bulk density, flowability and reconstitution behaviour, are influenced by the level of agglomeration occurring during the spray drying process. In the project StAgglop we aim to improve agglomeration control in industrial spray dryers, which can reduce energy use and off-spec powder production in the powder production chain. 
 In short: 
 
 During large scale production, lack of control of agglomeration negatively impacts operation efficiency of spray dryers and leads to significant material losses 
 Improved agglomeration control will contribute to the reduction of emissions and to meet increasing strict fine dust emission regulations for industrial drying systems 
 StAgglop therefore aims at developing scaling-relations to steer sticky behavior and agglomeration in spray drying processes 
 
 Reducing emissions by improving agglomeration control 
 Agglomeration during spray drying occurs when a partially-dried droplet collides with another partially-dried droplet or with a fully-dried (agglomerate) particle. There is a complex relationship between drying of droplets and agglomeration dynamics. The period, which starts with generation and exposure of a droplet to high inlet air temperature (resulting in extreme drying rates) and ends with collision with another partially-dried droplet or fully dried (agglomerate) particle is crucial for steering the agglomeration process. 
 In industrial practice, agglomeration is optimised by adapting the position and/or angle of (usually) high pressure nozzles, air flow pattern and presence of fines return to obtain agglomerated powder of desired quality. This approach is trial-and-error based and needs to be continuously repeated for different spray drying systems and products. 
 Lack of control of agglomeration negatively impacts operation efficiency of spray dryers (e.g. due to fouling and lower production capacities) and leads to significant material losses (in the form of off-spec product) during large scale production. It is estimated that for the Netherlands, annually 0.9-1.5 PJ energy or 200-300 kton CO 2  eq emission may be reduced by improving agglomeration control in spray dryers. Moreover, improved agglomeration control will contribute to the reduction of fine dust emission from dryers, for which increasingly strict regulations are reinforced by the government. 
 Steering sticky behaviour and agglomeration 
 The project StAgglop therefore aims at developing scaling-relations to steer sticky behavior and particle agglomeration in spray drying process. We develop these by: 
 
 Studying  drying kinetics, evolution of sticky surface properties and binary particle collisions at the single droplet scale 
 Investigating on pilot-scale sticky zones and agglomeration behavior in well-defined spray drying systems to move away from current empirical approaches. Translation of critical parameters obtained in single droplet drying studies will lead to recommendations for process conditions in spray drying, e. g. nozzle positions and angles, air flow and temperature

The Heat Is On,https://ispt.eu/projects/the-heat-is-on/,HP-50-01,Ongoing,"September 1, 2021","The Heat is On aims to make processes for dewatering, drying and heat integration more efficient. Energy reductions in heat driven processes can be realised through integration of drying technology, ICT, heat pumps and other technologies.  
 In short: 
 
 In many industries 40-80% of the CO 2  emissions are related to heat driven processes like separation and drying 
 Heat is now mainly generated from fossil fuels 
 Heat integration aims to balance between heat generation and use/reuse 
 The expected impact is up to 30% energy reduction in 2030 
 
 Heat driven processes are energy intensive 
 For industries like agrofood, paper and specialty chemicals, some 40-80% of the CO 2  emissions is related to the energy that is needed for heat driven processes like separation and drying. Heat is now mainly generated from fossil fuels and cascades through processes from high to low temperature. Heat integration is a balancing act between generation and use/reuse. As a result, a small change to achieve more energy efficiency in one part of the process, can have substantial effects.  
 Towards efficient separation and drying processes  
 In THIO parallel efforts are being made to increase process efficiency in unit operations, through  efficient separation and drying processes  that decrease the amount of water to be evaporated and increase the  heat upgrading potential  and smart process optimisation and control through  digital twins . 
 THIO applies a case driven system approach integrating these 3 innovations to achieve a significant savings in the amount of heat needed at the industry. 
 To obtain an optimal integral approach, the project innovations are organized from 2 perspectives:   
 
 Increasing the technological readiness levels: Technology development teams develop required individual dewatering and drying technologies, methods and concepts needed.   
 Increasing the innovation readiness levels: Case development teams focus on the realization of the impact at the industry partners, by integration of the technological solutions in the total heat reduction plan, ensuring appropriate business models and energy infrastructure, trained personnel, process control, etc.  
 
 This integrated system is supported and accelerated by a 3rd perspective:  
 
 Increasing the operational readiness levels: an Exploitation and impact team aims to accelerate the uptake and implementation of insights from the project by professionals and students by an online learning environment and organization of Learning Communities.  
 
 Expected impact: 30% energy reduction 
 Expected impact: 30% energy reduction in 2030 on average in the 3 industry sectors (paper, agrofood and specialty chemicals): >3,0 Mton CO 2  reduction in 2030 when implemented by all. THIO aims to have the following impact on the technical development:  
 
 Efficient dewatering and drying using high solids technologies that result in 10% less water to be evaporated/dried and subsequent energy reduction 
 Combined heat integration and drying innovations concepts that result in 50% less fossil fuel consumption for drying 
 Smart manufacturing solutions that result in 10% energy savings due to improved process control 
 
 Through these technologies, we aim to make the following impact on 3 cases in the industry.  
 
 An amazing project team 
 This project covers a broad range of stakeholders with representatives from the industry and input from scientists and researchers.  We are participating with companies with heat driven processes from the paper, agrofood and specialty chemicals industry, as well as knowledge, research and system integration partners to develop the technological solutions and convincing cases for the industry (e.g. finding, designing & testing innovations).

COMPRESORP,https://ispt.eu/projects/compresorp/,UH-20-10,Completed,"April 1, 2015","Upgrading low temperature waste water streams of separation processes with compression resorption heat pumps.  
 Goal 
 The goal of the COMPRESORP project is to upgrade low temperature waste streams from the process industry (e.g. cooling water from cooling towers) into valuable utility streams making use of compression-resorption heat pumps which operate in the wet regime.  
 Incentive 
 Thermal energy
(heat) represents a large part of the global energy usage and about 43% of this
energy is used for industrial applications. Ultimately, 20-50%
of the energy used is lost via waste heat contained in hot exhaust gases and liquid streams. Nevertheless the share of waste heat recovery
(upgraded energy) within the total energy used is still negligible. 
 Compression Resorption  heat Pumps (CRHP)  can be used to upgrade waste water streams to streams which are applicable for heating and cooling purposes. In this way the rest heat available inthese streams can be re-used in the separation processes. Waste water streams with temperatures in the range 35 to 60°C can be partly cooled down to 5°C and partly heated up to temperatures above the 110°C. These product flows with higher exergy can be used in separation processes which need cooling / heating respectively. Limiting for the commercial introduction of these cycles in practice is the unavailability of compressors which can operate under the operating conditions required by these cycles.  
 Objective 
 The focus of this project is on the development of a compressor suitable for the operating conditions of compression resorption cycle and its integration in the cycle. 
 
 Simplified P&ID of the experimental set-up 
 Twin screw compressor 
 
 A compressor prototype suitable for the operating conditions of compression-resorption heat pump cycles for heat recovery will be designed and experimentally tested. 
 Results 
 The impact of adding small amounts of CO 2  to the working fluid has been investigated. Indicating a ca. 5% improvement in COP. 
 COP of CRHPs heating pressurized water from 90 to 130 °C (a) and from 60 to 140 °C (b). Solid lines apply for NH 3 -H2O systems and dotted lines apply for NH 3  -H2O-CO2 systems. 
 A thermodynamic model has been developed for twin-screw wet compressors which allows localization of major irreversibility losses during the compression process in CRHPs. 
 Main irreversibility losses during compression 
 An experimental set-up has been constructed at the TU Delft to test the performance of the wet compressor prototype. 
 A summary of the results can be found in  Gudjonsdottir PhD thesis .

Steam and condensate quality,https://ispt.eu/projects/condensate-quality/,WP-20-11,Completed,"January 1, 2017","This project focuses on requiering better insights into the distribution and behaviour of conditioning chemicals that is used in their steam-water cycles and condensate polishing.   
 Process industries strive for more efficient use of water, saving energy and reducing thermal load of effluent discharged on surface water. This requires better insights into the distribution and behaviour of conditioning chemicals (and their breakdown products) used in their steam-water cycles and condensate polishing.  
 Project goals 
 The project aims are threefold: 
 Increased insight in the fate of conditioning chemicals (and the resulting protection) in stream-water cycles. Improved steam conditioning and condensate polishing and treatment, so that more condensate can be returned. Improved knowledge on harmful effects of different organic carbon (TOC) components, in relation to boiler feed guidelines.  
 Technical work packages 
 The project has three specific technical work packages. The first work package aims to elucidate the fate of boiler feed water conditioning chemicals after going through the steam cycle, including formation of breakdown products, distribution over the system and corresponding long-term impact on the metallurgy in the system. 
 The second work package aims at improved options of treating “off-spec” condensates, as well as heavily impaired process condensates, to increase water usage efficiency in the plant.  
 The third work package links the insights of the first work packages to corrosion measurements. This to improve insight in required boiler feed water treatment (especially with respect to TOC removal) and conditioning for improved protection of the plant. The scope includes filming and neutralizing amines and circuits operating at elevated temperature/ pressure (350-550 °C, 30-130 bar). 
 Expected results 
 This project results in a better description and modelling of the behavior, distribution and effect (in combination with proper monitoring) of different amines and organic pollutants, as well as their respective breakdown products in steam/ condensate circuits at elevated temperatures. 
 The project also delivers improved treatment options for “off-spec” and heavily impaired condensates, and will develop a robust Condensate Quality Assurance system.

LESSON – Oil free compressor for ammonia based high temperature heat pumps,https://ispt.eu/projects/lesson/,UH-30-07,Ongoing,"July 1, 2019","Wet compression allows for close to isothermal conditions during compression resulting in higher compression isentropic efficiencies. It further prevents operation in the superheating zone of the working fluids of heat pumps which are associated with large energy losses and the related unacceptably high discharge temperatures which cause problems in the compressors of high temperature heat pumps. 
 The project 
 In the frame of  Upgrading Low Temperature Waste Water Streams of Separation Processes with Compression  (UH-20-10)  project, currently under progress at  TU Delft ,  AtlasCopco  has created a prototype oil free wet compressor. At the end of this project experiments to determine its performance under high temperature heat pump conditions will be available showing its potential. 
 The data collected and reported in UH-20-10 concerns only the conditions at the inlet and outlet nozzles of the compressor. These data allow for validation of the global performance of the model which has been developed but is does not allow for identification of the sources of losses.  
 Oil free compressor for ammonia based high temperature heat pumps 
 This proposal aims to modify the prototype so that the variation of the internal pressure with the cavity volume can be experimentally determined. These data will allow for a detailed identification of the sources of losses during the compression process. In this way the model developed in project  UH-20-10  can be validated in more detail and where needed adjusted to represent the different sources of losses more accurately. The, in this way improved, compressor model will then be integrated in the complete compression resorption heat pump model to predict the heat pump performance in high temperature applications. 
 In parallel a compression resorption heat pump will be designed on paper which integrates the lessons learned from the compressor prototype and modeling into a next generation commercial compressor adapted for this purpose and which also integrates the other components of the heat pump. The designed heat pump capacity will be sized similar to the present compressor prototype to about 250 kW heating power. 
 Results 
 The system has been operated with an ammonia concentration of 30% in an ammonia water solution. Compressor inlet conditions around 60 °C (this corresponds to a heat source of about 65 °C) and vapour inlet qualities in the range 50 to 90 %. 
 The experimental data show clearly that larger amounts of liquid at the suction port (lower vapour quality) guarantees the sealing of the leakage paths and allow for higher pressure ratios. 
 Left: Pressure ratio as function of compressor inlet quality; Right: temperature lift across the compressor. In both figures the rotational speed has been varied. 
 The figure on the right hand side shows how the vapour inlet quality affects the temperature rise as the working fluid passes the compressor. Discharge temperatures are up to 125 °C so that heat could be delivered to an application at 120 °C.

Demonstration Polymer Heat Exchanger,https://ispt.eu/projects/demonstration-polymer-heat-exchanger/,UH-30-01,Ongoing,"May 1, 2017","The goal of this project is to demonstrate the innovative technologies as developed by HeatMatrix in the industrial process in the BioMCN factories.  
 On the one hand this would result in a major energy economization at the BioMCN plants on the other hand it’s meant to create a reference-project for HeatMatrix as a stepping stone to repetition and commercial implementation. To realize this goal four parties will work together; BioMCN as the end-user, HeatMatrix as the technology supplier, Stork as the EPC contractor and the ISPT as a networking agent for sustainable process innovation.  
 About the Project 
 BioMCN in Delfzij l is a methanol producer who uses natural gas as feedstock. They also produce waste gas that has a temperature of about 300 degrees Celsius. BioMCN is looking for technical and financially feasible methods to extract energy from these waste gasses and put them to good use. 
 Conventional heat-return-systems cannot function in the temperature-range of 150-50 degrees. This is why HeatMatrix is working on a so-called ‘Polymer Heat Exchanger’. HeatMatrix is a Shell Spin-out company. The material (plastic) and the design have been specially designed for the lower ranges. In the past few years different test-setups have been built on different scales (5 KW and 500KW) with the support of the ministry of economic affairs. The process Industry however is looking for setups that are 10 times bigger than the ones that were tested (5MW). And as long as this technique hasn’t been proven to work on this large scale further commercialisation is difficult. 
 The project will be a demonstration project and it will include a knowledge dissemination program. Stork will be in charge of the engineering, preparation and implementation of the required adjustments of the methanol-factory.  
 Engineering will be start up in November 2017 and equipment purchasing process will start up in 2018. When the technology is operational the results will be monitored. The setup will be available as showcase and demo-setup. ISPT will provide the knowledge distribution for this project.

 Results 
 The demonstration project aims to achieve the following results: 
 To realize a significant reduction in energy use at the BioMCN plant. To realize a key reference project for  HeatMatrix  as a starting point for further commercialization within the process industry. To provide exposure to the Dutch energy intensive industry clusters (Amsterdam, Rotterdam/ Moerdijk, Terneuzen and Geleen). An active replication program under the supervision of the ISPT aiming for 3 repetitions (up to 1.2 PJ). To initiate the exportation of the HeatMatrix technology To create an onset for extra employment opportunities at HeatMatrix and Stork.

VERA – Accelerating Energy Transition Realization Approach,https://ispt.eu/projects/vera/,ST-20-05,Completed,"September 1, 2017","The Vera project aims to further develop and implement industrial heat pumps in the Netherlands. 
 Heat pump technology has a lot of potential. For instance to reduce energy-use, promote electrification, and stimulate circularity in industrial processes. However, the success of industrial heat pump technology strongly depends on how well its innovation system develops. 
 The Vera project aims to identify ways to improve the conditions for further development and implementation of industrial heat pumps in the Netherlands. It does so by analyzing its Technological Innovation System (TIS). As a result, it analyzes how well seven key processes are fulfilled and which problems are inhibiting TIS performance.  
 In addition, the project formulates interventions that increase TIS performance, consequently contributing to further development and implementation of industrial heat humps in the Netherlands.

PINcHED – Process INtegrated HEat pump Drying,https://ispt.eu/projects/pinched/,DR-20-14,Completed,"April 1, 2019","This project creates greenfield conceptual design packages for contact and convective drying of a full scale. In addition, it focuses on establishing a fully heat pump integrated drying process, including a selection of main components, process flow diagram, control philosophy, and draft lay out drawings.  
 Drying processes account for 15% of industrial energy consumption. In some processes, e.g. paper production, up to 70% of the energy is used for drying. Improving of the energy efficiency of drying processes will therefore contribute significantly to energy saving targets and to the reduction of the CO 2  emissions. All bulk drying processes are either convective or contact drying. Both contact drying and convective drying are suitable for heat pump application. The installed process equipment in brown field situations is not designed to be suitable for heat pump applications both in the systems which supply process heat as well as in the heat recovery systems. Connecting a heat pump straight onto existing installations will therefore give rise to even more inefficiencies. The next step in heat pump development concentrates on heat pump process integration: drying functionality is designed including the heat pump functionality.  
 
 For an optimal design both technical and economic factors for the integral heat pump driven drying systems will be modelled and calculated looking to find the optimal balance between standardization and customization. Cost calculations for the different systems will be made to enable the establishment of economic feasibility and comparison of the different designs. The PiNCHED project is the design step towards building the full-scale systems in follow up projects.

CRUISE – Cost Reduction Industrial Heatpumps,https://ispt.eu/projects/cruise/,UH-20-11,Ongoing,"October 1, 2016","The objective of this project is to develop 50% less expensive heat pump technology that generates heat in an economically feasible way for industrial applications, using waste heat and (renewable) electricity. This technology can be applied cross sectoral and offers large energy savings. The cost target range is between  150-200 €/kWth . 
 In short: 
 
 Developing a 50% less expensive heat pump technology 
 For industrial application 
 A final report on the cost reduction, new compression heatpump and a market analysis  
 
 About the CRUISE project 
 The project starts with identifying the specific needs of the industrial end-users and the specific requirements of heat pump integration, by close cooperation between industrial end-users and technology providers. Options for cost reduction are identified by the technology providers and  ECN  and assessed in a separate work package. Two heat pump concepts (compression & thermoacoustic) will be manufactured and tested that meet the cost objective of this project. Testing of both concepts will be carried out by ECN. A separate work package is devoted to defining the market potential, including dissemination, carried out by ISPT and FME.  
 The achieved results 
 The project results are split up into four sections: cost reductions, compression heat pump, thermo-acoustic heat pump and market analysis. The summary of the results is available below, please check also the CRUISE Public Report (in Dutch) for more details, the report can be downloaded under all project publications. 
 1. Cost reductions 
 The cost reduction study for compression heat pumps shows that serial construction and application of other types of compressors can reduce the investment costs at least in half from the current 500 € / kWth to 250 € / kWth for a system on a 2 MW scale. Based on these principles, a conceptual design with use of non-flammable working medium has been made for a 2 MW heat pump. 
 2. Compression heat pump 
 Results indicate that it is also possible to generate high-temperature heat in the form of steam with a synthetic working medium. It is expected that with the tested working medium in combination with a suitable oil comparable performance, both in terms of delivery temperature and efficiency, can be achieved as Pentane. 
 3. Thermo-acoustic heat pump 
 Within this project it was decided to connect an existing heat pump (TASTE project, TEEI314009) to a new, larger compressor. After design adjustments and starting the compressor, it was found that the intended operating range could not be reached when increasing the speed. The cause of this appears to be a small opening in the (temporary) bypass line. This causes a lot of losses and must be removed. Despite the low pressure amplitude, a clear pumping action was visible. The thermocouples in the system showed a rapid build-up of a temperature gradient across the regenerator, indicating that heat pump operation is taking place. 
 4. Market analyses 
 To determine the market for industrial heat pumps, a bottom-up analysis of applications in the EU-28 has been made. The bottom-up market study shows valuable results regarding the application potential of industrial heat pumps in the EU-28 up to a delivery temperature of 200 ° C. Based on available data, a market potential of 24.6 GW is calculated, which supplies 655 PJ of heat to industrial processes. The study has also increased insight into the desired capacities of an industrial heat pump. The large numbers, and therefore possibilities for series production, are for power sizes <10 MW. The market study can be further improved by better availability of process data.
